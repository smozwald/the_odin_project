# The Odin Project

The Odin Project is a free resource for learning web development. I have followed the learning path (however substituting Python and Django for Ruby due to my own background and interests) and completed a number of projects to build my skills in software development as a whole. Projects listed numerically (from 001) are major projects of the course in the order they were completed, other projects are also included (not numbered).

At the start of this project, I was unaware of the issues that arise when trying to include a git repository both as its own and a submodule of another project, thus I abandoned this effort pretty early.
